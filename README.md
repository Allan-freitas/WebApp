 Controle facilmente as suas despesas e receitas, acompanhando as movimentações financeiras no caixa e nos bancos, e ainda organizando por categorias, conforme a necessidade. Além disso, com o fluxo de caixa e o balancete, é possível garantir a documentação de entradas e saídas, sabendo sempre com antecedência se você tem recursos disponíveis para garantir a saúde financeira do seu negócio. 

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Here's why:
* Easily control your expenses and income, tracking financial transactions at the cashier and banks
* and still organizing by categories, as needed. Also, with the cash flow and balance sheet
* it is possible to guarantee the documentation of entries and exits, always knowing in advance if you have available resources to guarantee the financial health of your business :smile:
